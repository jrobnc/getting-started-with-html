    <p><h1>The the following items were discussed for Stage 0:</h1>
      <h3>The World Wide Web - WWW</h3><br>
    The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other via the Internet. When a person goes to a web page their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
      <p><h3>HTML</h3>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". This video gives a good overview.</p>
      <p><h3>Tags & Elements (inline vs block) </h3>HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them </p>
      <p><h3>Computers are stupid: </h3> This refers to the idea that computers only do what they are "told."</p><br>
